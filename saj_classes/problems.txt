1. Problem:
	"if ((obj1 != NULL) && (obj2 != NULL))" is still allowing objects that have been assigned to NULL through.
	Solution:
	Use a boolean property in entity class to indicate existence state of objects. Manipulation of this boolean will indicate object status (ie dead or alive).
	OR
	Check if health is <=0.
	Status: SOLVED.
